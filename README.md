Some people believe you have to be a programmer to practice coding. I believe that even if your job may not even come close to the title of a programmer, coding can still be used to aid your every day life. For eample I myself am an astrophysics student studying the stars not silcon, however, I enjoy using coding to help conceptualize scientific concepts. So, I have decided to share either my hobbie projects or code I made to accomplish mundane tasks in hopes it will either peak your intrest or help prevent a headache. For those who are programmers enjoy it and for those who are non-programmers take it as inspiration to learn coding as tool to help in your chosen profession.
